# Advent of Code 2017

Solutions in 25 languages, one for each day.

### Running

First, get your inputs from the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2017) site.

Each solution expects the input from stdin, building and running depends on the language.

If you wish to use the [Makefile](Makefile), the inputs should be placed in the directory
for the corresponding day named `input.txt`.

```shell
make     # build and run all the solutions
make 22  # run the specified day(s)
```
